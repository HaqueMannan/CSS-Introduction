Introdction to CSS
====================================================================

1. CSS stads for Cascading Style Sheets.
2. CSS is not a progrmamming language.
3. CSS is a styling language
4. CSS is used for website layout and design.
5. CSS can be used alongside mockups such as HTML, XML, XHTML, SVG etc.
6. CSS by defualt does not have logic (strictly presentational) however can be extended with Sass/Less (it is advisable to learn one of the two precompilers after learning CSS as it allows you to use variables and conditionals etc.)

The code editor used: VS Code (note: any code editor can be used such as Atom, Sublime Text, Notepad++ etc.)
The browser used: Google Chrome (note: any other editor can be used such as Firefox, Safari, Edge etc.)

The CSS/Cheatsheet/CSS/style.css is a CSS Cheatsheet. The CSS Cheatsheet will be used as a reference guide on CSS syntax. We also require a index.html file to link the CSS styling.
CSS have many properties and this Cheatsheet will not be covering everything. This is a beginners guide on the fundementals of CSS. You should refer to external sources for more advanced CSS stylings once you are familiar with the basics.

This will help provide a visual guide on:
1. CSS syntax
2. How the code translates (looks like) within the browser
3. How we can write CSS styles to manipulate elements/contents of a HTML page.

The MyWebsite project demonstrates what we have learned in the CSS cheatsheet (i.e. clean code example).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are three Methods for adding CSS (All shown in the Cheatsheet.)
1. Inline CSS - directly in the html element (this is bad practice and should be avoided).
2. Internal CSS - using <style> tags within a signle document. (<Style Tags> appears in the Head section of a HTML and this will only apply to the html page it is within. This should also be avoided.).
3. External CSS - linking as external .css file (this is best practice).

You should always keep the functionality (HTML) and the styling (CSS) of a webpage as seperate as possible and so External CSS should always be used.
